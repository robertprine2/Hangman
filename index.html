				<p>You are a zombie. It's good to be a zombie. You don't need a large vocabulary. "Uhhh," "Rrrr," and "Brains" pretty much cover everything you need to say. You have lots of friends. Well, they are mainly just other zombies that walk around with you, but they feel like friends. Last, but not least, you have the best job in the world: eating brains!. It may be dangerous, but you love it! The only real question is: How many brains can you eat by guessing zombie related skull passwords through telepathically sending the information to the brain carrier's skull before you are cut to bits? It turns out people don't want you to eat their brains. Weird, right?</p>

				<h3>Directions:</h3>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Make your first guess of the zombie related skull password through telepathically sending the information to the brain carrier's skull. In other words, press a letter key.</li>
					<li>Continue to guess letters until you have figured out the password.</li>
					<li>Eat brains! &lt;3</li>
					<li>Beware! If you fail to guess the password correctly too many times, the brain container might retaliate by slicing you to bits!</li>
